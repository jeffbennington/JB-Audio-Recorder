Your sound is under full control! JB Audio Recorder is a lightweight and powerful audio recording tool for those who value quality. Forget about complex configurations: record audio in popular formats with customizable bitrate and frequency. The built-in intelligent noise reduction algorithm will clear your voice from background sounds.

Convenient Player and Library. No more searching for files all over your system. Preview your recording directly in the app and decide whether to save it or re-record. All successful takes go straight into a visual library, where they can be easily found and opened with a single click.

Work the way you want. The recorder can operate in the background or stay handy with the "Always on Top" mode. Control your recording using global hotkeys and don't worry about the results — the system will alert you if you try to exit with an unsaved file.
